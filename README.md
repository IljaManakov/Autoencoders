# Autoencoders
This repository contains the tools necessary to flexibly build an autoencoder in pytorch. In the future some more investigative tools may be added.

Some usefull wrappers and custom classes, such as ResidualBlock or GeneralConvolution, can be found in model_parts.py.
The file models.py is where the actual autoencoder classes are. It contains one base class as well as two extension for 2d and 3d data.
